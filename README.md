## Git Practice

Found this article about Continuous-Integration Link to the [particle](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration).

#### Quick definition:

> Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

A take away from the article is that CI needs a version control system, which we learned git is a great VSC. Once VSC has been established to the WIP project, the next thing to include is integration approval steps. Some example of approval steps would be adding automated tests, syntax checkers, code style formatters. Approval steps checks the merge attempt made by contributors.

A polished CI pipeline would be a great addition to any company. Not only that it makes the life of the engeineering team a lot better, but also the whole organization, in which CI provides a transparency that promotes communication between the client and the developers.
